# PoDu-Redux

Run main game window with PoDuReDux.pyw

Requirements:
-Python 3.6+
-Python Arcade library ("pip install arcade" in a command prompt)
-python-tk on Ubuntu-based systems (sudo apt-get install python-tk)
-OpenGL 3.3+, per the Arcade library's requirements

Essential files currently include:
-PoDuReDux.pyw

CUSTOMIZATION:

-Custom backgrounds can be added to the named folder in /images
-Custom teams can be added to /saves/team/. See example files in that folder. Peruse pokemon-stats.json with Ctrl-F to find valid figures and their correct referrents.

I am a 100% amateur coder, so please pardon the spaghetti.
I will document known bugs eventually, but keep in mind many of them are the result of pending implementations.

Quick n dirty. Enjoy.
