# PoDu-Redux

Run main game window with PoDuReDux.py

Requirements:
-Python 3.6+
-Python Arcade library ("pip install arcade" in a command prompt)

Essential files currently include:
-PoDuReDux.py
-pokemon-stats.json
-/saves
-/images


CUSTOMIZATION:

-Custom backgrounds can be added to the named folder in /images
-Custom teams can be added to /saves/team/. See example files in that folder. Peruse pokemon-stats.json with Ctrl-F to find valid figures and their correct referrents.

I am a 100% amateur coder, so please pardon the spaghetti.
I will document known bugs eventually, but keep in mind many of them are the result of pending implementations.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS:

-u/Wendy_S_Pennies from Reddit for the board overlays
-TPC, Heroz, etc for the original game
-Anybody who has offered me advice on this project thus far

Quick n dirty. Enjoy.
