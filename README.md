To run the game, navigate to /files/PoDu-Redux/PoDuReDux.pyw

/files/PoDu-Redux also includes the LibraryCardViewer.pyw and LibraryTextViewer.pyw to browse unit information. Custom teams can be built by adding a properly formatted text file to the appropriate folder for the chosen game mode in /files/PoDu-ReDux/saves/, each of which contains example files

This project is a reverse-engineering project that was worked primarily between late 2019 and early 2020 when the mobile game Pokemon Duel was shuttered. It was one of my first Python projects, and as such I used it as a learning tool. As is, it recreates some of the basic game mechanics (including battles, Wait, Freeze, Shoves, and Evolution, inexhaustively) in a local environment and allows very basic local multiplayer games by using the Arcade Python library. The project was originally intended as a community-oriented attempt to fully recreate the original game, garnering some attention and coverage from YouTubers, however it was shuttered due to lack of public participation and personal time constraints.

Given the age of the project and the overhaul required to improve/modernize it, there will be no further development. However, this project can be used as an example for building a game hosting server to which clients can connect.
