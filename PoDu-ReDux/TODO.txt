MAKE BETTER BOARD
Tracking tools
rulebook
make tokens for plates?

Z-Move planned numbers:
check numbers at end of each players turn
+1 start of turn, initiate attack, experience ko, miss
Double: your zone occupied, you occupy opponent, you have empty board
Gauge max: probably 32, maybe 36
An abacus would work pretty well, but thats probably beneath most people. Dungeon Dice Monsters did it, why not??
